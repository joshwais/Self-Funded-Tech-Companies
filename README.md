# Self-Funded Tech Companies

All the mythology and all the noise in the tech world makes it seem like there's only one forumla for starting a tech company... think of an idea and then raise money.

But, there is another way. It IS possible to start and grow a tech-driven company without raising VC funding.

Since examples can be hard to come by, this list is an attempt to aggregate as many as possible in order to be instructive and inspirational for others looking to start a company like these.
